### Web Scraping F1 race results and exploring Snowflake
I completed all the web scraping and data cleaning utilizing python and BeautifulSoup within the Jupyter environment and saved the final dataframe as a csv file in a S3 bucket. Next I connected to the S3 bucket with a Snowflake data warehouse created a database and tables. I utilized SQL to create some visualizations within the Snowflake environment. Finally I connected my data warehouse to Tableau and created a simple dashboard of my analysis and exploration to be abale to visualize my findings in more depth.
