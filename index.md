### Real-Time News Sentiment Analysis Pipeline on GCP
With all the negativity in news headlines recently, it can be a real strain on mental health when you are constantly bombarded with negative news articles and headlines. This project was intended to assist, when you just need a break from negative news articles and want to filter news by positive, neutral or negative sentiment. This was the problem I wanted to create a solution for and by developing a pipeline that performs real-time sentiment analysis on news articles and allows for the user to filter results based on positive or negative sentiment of each article.

The objective of this project is to determine the ‘health’ of all 3 product categories in this dataset. We want to understand and capture trends & seasonality, but also predict profits for each category for the next couple years. While doing so, I will explore some of the best models and statistical methods to work with and make predictions with time-series data.

Next I connected to the S3 bucket with a Snowflake data warehouse created a database and tables. I utilized SQL to create some visualizations within the Snowflake environment. Finally I connected my data warehouse to Tableau and created a simple dashboard of my analysis and exploration to be abale to visualize my findings in more depth.
